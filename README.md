DOMAIN:DATA SCIENCE

DURATION:4 WEEKS

MENTOR:NEELA SANTOSH

ENTER DESCRIPTION OF TASK:
This project focuses on building an optimization model to maximize production profit using given input data. By applying mathematical modeling and optimization techniques, the solution determines the optimal number of units to produce for each product to achieve the highest possible profit while meeting given constraints. The approach ensures resource utilization is efficient, waste is minimized, and decision-making is backed by data.

Tools and Technologies Used

Python – Core programming language for implementing the optimization model
Pandas – Data loading, manipulation, and CSV file handling
NumPy – Numerical calculations and array handling
Matplotlib – Data visualization and plotting graphs for analysis
Jupyter Notebook – Interactive environment for coding and testing
PuLP (or similar library) – Linear programming solver for optimization
Git & GitHub – Version control and repository hosting
VS Code – Code editing and project execution

Project Workflow

1. Understanding the Problem
Given input data containing product details, costs, and constraints.
Goal: Determine units of each product to maximize profit.

2. Data Preparation
Load input CSV file using Pandas.
Clean and format data for further processing.

3. Formulating the Optimization Problem
Define decision variables (e.g., units to produce).
Define objective function (maximize total profit).
Apply constraints (e.g., resource limits, production capacities).

4. Model Implementation
Use Python’s PuLP library to implement the optimization model.
Solve the linear programming problem to get the optimal solution.

5. Result Storage & Visualization
Save optimal production plan to production.csv.
Create bar chart to visualize production distribution and profits.
Export visualization as an image for reference.

6. Final Output
Optimal number of units per product.
Profit per unit and total profit achieved.

Applications of the Project

Manufacturing Industry – Determining the most profitable production mix.
Supply Chain Optimization – Managing resources effectively.
Business Decision Making – Backing strategies with data.
Cost Optimization – Reducing waste while increasing output efficiency.
